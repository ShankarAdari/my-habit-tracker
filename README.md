My Habit Tracker (RPG-Lite Edition)
Transform your daily routines into a quest for growth.

📌 The "Why"
Traditional habit trackers often feel like chores. My Habit Tracker solves the "consistency burnout" by applying game design principles to wellness. It treats habits as quests, hydration as mana, and mental exercises as training, making self-improvement addictive and measurable.

🚀 Core Features

RPG Gamification: A sophisticated XP system where users level up, earn in-app points, and compete on global leaderboards.

Health Dashboard: Real-time analytics for water intake, sleep quality, and habit streaks.

Resilient API Layer: Built with tRPC, featuring robust error handling and default data states to prevent UI crashes during data fetching.
